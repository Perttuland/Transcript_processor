# AI Transcript Processor

A powerful, agentic AI-driven application for processing, analyzing, and extracting insights from transcripts. This tool leverages a multi-agent system to break down transcripts, generate analysis frameworks, and provide deep insights with a premium, fluid user experience.

## Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: Upload `.docx`, `.md`, `.txt`, or `.pdf` files, or paste text directly.
- **Context Awareness**: AI automatically detects context, tags metadata, and proposes analysis objectives.
- **Dynamic Framework Generation**: The "Planner" agent creates a structured analysis framework tailored to your transcript.
- **Deep Analysis**: "Writer" and "Critic" agents work in tandem to generate and verify insights.
- **Gap Analysis**: Automatically identifies and fills missing themes or unexplored areas.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Watch agents think and write in real-time for a transparent and engaging experience.
- **Consolidation**: Easily review, edit, and export the final analysis as a Markdown file.
